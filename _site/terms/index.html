<h3>WHAT DO BOTH PARTIES AGREE TO DO?</h3>
<p>As our client, you have the power to enter into this contract on behalf of your company or organization. You agree to provide us with everything necessary to complete the project including logo, text, images, link(s) to social media, hosting credentials and any other information we request as we need it, and in the format we require. We wish to avoid any delays. Deadlines work both ways and you as well will be bound by any dates/timelines that we set forth. You also agree to adhere to the payment schedule outlined in this agreement.</p>
<p>We have the experience and ability to perform the requested services and will carry out our work in a professional and timely manner. We cannot be held responsible for a missed website launch date or deadline if you have not provided all content and/or revisions on time.</p>
<h3>TIMELINE</h3>
<p>Our estimated time required to complete your website is 30-60 days. We will commence the work after we have received a signed contract and the non-refundable initial deposit of 50 percent. Please also keep in mind that we rely on you and your team to provide us with the necessary assets (including but not limited to website text, photos, social media, products, pricing, etc.), and approvals in order for us to work on your website, and to avoid impacting your website launch date.</p>
<h3>ERROR REVIEW</h3>
<p>We provide you with a 7 day window from the date of website migration to your hosting for error review. This does not include new website revisions, but errors that may have occurred during migration. It is your responsibility as the client to review your website during this time and point out any errors to be corrected. Any error that you find after the 7 days, will be charged our hourly rate of $50.00.</p>
<h3>MIGRATION OF WEBSITE</h3>
<p>Once the project deliverables have been approved, we require full payment of your project’s remaining balance before migrating your website onto your hosting. From the time the website is completed and ready for launch, you have a maximum of 30 days to provide us with your hosting and domain information. If that information is not provided, there is a possibility that the website will be removed from our server without notice. Extensions can be provided upon written request.</p>
<h3>RECOMMENDED HOSTING</h3>
<p>We recommend the following hosts (specific packages are outlined), to ensure that you have a smooth migration experience and ensure no additional billable time. As the client, you are responsible for the management and maintenance of your hosting and domain at all times. All hosting/domain packages must be paid annually to the hosting company of your choosing. The recommended hosting services are Digital Ocean, Amazon Web, Blue Host and Go Daddy. Digital Designers have no affiliation with any of the hosting service providers.</p>
<h3>BROWSER FUNCTIONALITY</h3>
<p>All of our websites are tested for functionality on current Safari, Chrome, Firefox internet browsers. We do not guarantee that your website will look exactly the same on every screen, and may appear differently due to varying screen resolutions and aspect ratios.</p>
<h3>STATEMENT OF WORK</h3>
<p>We have prepared the price quote (refer to page 1) based on everything that we have discussed, including any correspondence via email, in-person, or phone calls. The breakdown is outlined in the Statement of Work document which includes the scope of work, project objectives, tasks, deliverables, certain terms, conditions and requirements as well as payment of the project. We are only responsible for the items outlined in the Statement of Work. Items not included in the Statement of Work are not part of the project nor have they been included in the quoted cost.</p>
<h3>ADDITIONS</h3>
<p>Please review the Statement of Work and if you have any additional feature requests, changes in tasks, changes in deliverables or any scope modifications, beyond what was agreed and signed off on in the original Statement of Work, additional billable time will be incurred to you as the client at our hourly rate of $50.00.</p>
<h3>REVISIONS</h3>
<p>The price estimate includes time for revisions, and that will not exceed 10 percent of the total budget of web development time mentioned on page 2. Should you request additional revisions beyond what is included, or that exceed the allocated time, you will receive an email notification from us requesting a confirmation that you wish to proceed with said revisions and agree that you will be billed at our hourly rate of $50.00. After we have received your confirmation we will proceed.</p>
<h3>ALLOWANCES</h3>
<p>You are responsible for the cost of any outside paid assets. This is included but not limited to hosting, domains, SSL certificates, third party plugins, stock images, and premium fonts. In addition, we cannot be held liable for the functionality of third-party plugin or software, recommended or otherwise.</p>
<h3>EXCLUSIVE DESIGN CREDIT</h3>
